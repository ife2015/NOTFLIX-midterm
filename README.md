Buy/Sell Movie Listing Website
=========

NOTFLIX is a simple app that lets buyers buy the movies they are looking for quickly, and easily contact an admin. The admin can add new movie genres and movie listings. Sellers have the option of buying their selected movie, rating and leaving a review, keeping a list of their favorite movies, and finally filtering through a list of movies.
